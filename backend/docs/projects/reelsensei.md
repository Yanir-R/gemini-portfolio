# ReelSensei - AI Gaming Highlights

**Status: paused. Not publicly available.** The repository is private, the service is not
running, and I have not decided whether to take it further. It is here because the engineering
is worth reading about, not because it is a product you can sign up for.

ReelSensei turns long gaming recordings into highlight reels: a multimodal model scores moments,
and an asynchronous pipeline does the cutting. What made it interesting was never the model - it
was getting video processing to run at a cost that made sense, on Spot VMs and batch jobs, without
a queue that could quietly lose work.

The write-up below describes the system as it was built and last ran.

## Overview
Paused and private: the service is not running and the repository is closed. It turned long gaming recordings into highlight reels - a multimodal model scored the moments, an asynchronous pipeline did the cutting. The hard part was cost, not detection: running video processing on Spot VMs and batch jobs cheaply enough to be worth it, without a queue that could silently drop work.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Frontend Deployment
- **Cloud Run Static Hosting**: The frontend is built as a static site (using `next export` for Next.js), then served via a lightweight container on Google Cloud Run. This enables serverless, scalable, and cost-efficient global delivery.
- **Build & Deploy Workflow**:
  1. Run `next build && next export` to generate static assets in the `out/` directory.
  2. Use a minimal web server (e.g., [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) or [nginx]) in a Docker container to serve the static files.
  3. Deploy the container to Cloud Run for automatic HTTPS, scaling, and global availability.
- **CDN Integration**: Optionally, connect Cloud Run to Google Cloud CDN or a third-party CDN for even faster global delivery and edge caching.
- **CI/CD**: Automated builds and deployments via GitHub Actions or Cloud Build for zero-downtime updates.
- **Static export** mode for cost optimization
- **CDN integration** for global content delivery

### Backend Deployment
- **Google Cloud Run** for scalable container hosting
- **Docker** containerization with multi-stage builds
- **Load balancer** integration with health checks

All video processing is fully asynchronous, orchestrated through Google Cloud Tasks and GCP Batch
so that a long job never blocks a request and a failed worker never loses one.
