Hi, I'm Yanir Rot ðŸ‘‹
As a Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating impactful web solutions, I thrive on delivering high-quality applications that make a difference.

At Moonsite, I lead the development of sophisticated financial applications and sports betting platforms, combining technical expertise with user-centric design principles. Previously at Devforce, I contributed to innovative SaaS solutions and collaborated with leading media companies to enhance their digital presence.

My background and experience across the full development stack allows me to bridge the gap between technical requirements and business needs. I specialize in React, React-Native TypeScript, and modern web technologies, with a proven track record of building responsive, dynamic applications.

I'm particularly skilled in end-to-end web development and automated testing, always ensuring that solutions are not just functional, but also maintainable and scalable. My experience as a co-founder at Tauora Products has given me valuable insights into product development from concept to market.
